# Time Series of stocks

The historical data of stock prices for four stocks is taken from the [Yahoo Finance Api](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yahoo-finance1) through HTTP GET request.

This data is then combined and transformed to a csv file

Using open source projects Dash and Plotly a reactive, web-based dashboard is created.
